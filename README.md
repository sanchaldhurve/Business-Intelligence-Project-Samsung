# Business-Intelligence-Project-Samsung-Electronics

As an aspiring data analyst, I conducted an in-depth BI project exploring the mobile phone manufacturing industry with a focus on Samsung, Apple, and Nokia. Using diverse datasets—including Samsung stock prices, mobile phone sales rankings, and device price comparisons—I built an interactive dashboard that reveals key industry trends. The analysis uncovered insights such as Samsung's 289% share price growth from 2016–2022, Nokia's dominance in unit sales, and Samsung’s position as the premium-priced manufacturer. I used dashboard filters and drill-through functionality to support detailed comparisons, making it easier for stakeholders to identify top-selling models, evaluate price-performance tradeoffs, and inform purchase or investment decisions. This project highlights my ability to merge data storytelling with technical skills in **Power BI**, **data cleaning**, and **analytical reasoning**.
